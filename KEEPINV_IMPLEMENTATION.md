# Keep Inventory Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented an opt-out per-player keep inventory feature for the Fleet Tools mod. This system allows players to individually control whether they keep their items on death, without affecting the server's global gamerule.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. `/keepinv` Command

- **`/keepinv`** - Toggles your personal keep inventory setting
- **`/keepinv status`** - Shows your current keep inventory status
- **`/keepinv <player>`** - Toggles keep inventory for another player (admin only)
- Permissions: `fleettools.keepinv` (default: all players), `fleettools.keepinv.others` (default: operators)

### 2. Default Configuration

- Keep inventory is **enabled by default** for all new players
- Players can opt-out if they prefer the vanilla death experience
- Setting is stored per-player and persists across sessions

### 3. Comprehensive Mod Compatibility

- Works with vanilla inventories (main, armor, offhand)
- Compatible with modded inventories, trinkets, and backpacks
- Uses event-based approach for maximum compatibility

### 4. XP Loss Maintained

- Players still lose XP when they die (as intended)
- Only items are preserved, maintaining some consequence for death

## Technical Implementation

### Data Storage

- Player preferences stored in `PlayerDataManager`
- Per-player JSON files in `fleettools/players/` directory
- Default value: `keepInventory = true` for new players

### Event Handling

- `KeepInventoryHandler` class manages death events
- Uses Fabric's `ServerLivingEntityEvents` for robust event handling
- Stores inventory contents before death and restores after respawn
- Provides user feedback about item preservation

### Command System

- Enhanced existing `KeepInvCommand` with status subcommand
- Proper permission handling for self vs. other player management
- Clear messaging about current state and changes

## Build Status

✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** - All features compiled and tested

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:

- `Fabric/src/main/java/com/fleettools/commands/KeepInvCommand.java` - Enhanced with status command
- `Fabric/src/main/java/com/fleettools/data/PlayerDataManager.java` - Already had keep inventory methods
- `Fabric/src/main/java/com/fleettools/FleettoolsMod.java` - Registered new event handler
- `README.md` - Added documentation for keep inventory feature

### Created Files:

- `Fabric/src/main/java/com/fleettools/events/KeepInventoryHandler.java` - Core keep inventory logic

## Usage Instructions

### For Players:

1. **Check Status**: `/keepinv status` - See if keep inventory is enabled
2. **Toggle Setting**: `/keepinv` - Turn keep inventory on/off for yourself
3. **Default Behavior**: Keep inventory is enabled by default for all players

### For Administrators:

1. **Manage Other Players**: `/keepinv <player>` - Toggle keep inventory for any player
2. **Permission Control**: Use `fleettools.keepinv.others` permission to control who can manage others

## Compatibility Notes

- ✅ Works with vanilla Minecraft inventories
- ✅ Compatible with modded inventory expansions (trinkets, backpacks, etc.)
- ✅ Does not interfere with server gamerules
- ✅ Per-player setting independent of global configuration
- ✅ Maintains XP loss on death as intended
