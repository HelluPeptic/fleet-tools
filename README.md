# Fleet Tools - Essential Commands for Fabric

Fleet Tools is a comprehensive Fabric mod that brings essential server administration commands to Minecraft Fabric servers. This mod provides server administrators with teleportation, moderation, utility, and administrative commands with full permission support and tab completion.

## Features

### Home System

- **`/home`** - Teleport to your home location
- **`/sethome`** - Set your home at your current location
- **`/delhome`** - Delete your home location
- Permission: `fleettools.home`, `fleettools.sethome`, `fleettools.delhome` (default: operators only)

### Spawn System

- **`/spawn`** - Teleport to the server spawn
- **`/setspawn`** - Set the server spawn at your current location (admin only)
- Permission: `fleettools.spawn`, `fleettools.setspawn` (default: operators only)

### Back System

- **`/back`** - Return to your previous location
- Permission: `fleettools.back` (default: operators only)

### Teleportation

- **`/tpo <player>`** or **`/tpoffline <player>`** - Teleport to any player's location (online or offline)
- **`/top <player>`** - Teleport to the highest block above current position
- Permission: `fleettools.tpo`, `fleettools.top`, `fleettools.top.others` (default: operators only)

### Health & Hunger

- **`/heal [player]`** - Restore health to full and clear negative effects
- **`/feed [player]`** - Restore hunger and saturation to full
- Permission: `fleettools.heal`, `fleettools.heal.others`, `fleettools.feed`, `fleettools.feed.others` (default: operators only)

### Flight System

- **`/fly [player]`** - Toggle flight mode
- Permission: `fleettools.fly`, `fleettools.fly.others` (default: operators only)

### Game Mode

- **`/gamemode <mode> [player]`** - Change game mode
- **`/gmc [player]`** - Switch to Creative mode
- **`/gms [player]`** - Switch to Survival mode
- **`/gma [player]`** - Switch to Adventure mode
- **`/gmsp [player]`** - Switch to Spectator mode
- Permission: `fleettools.gamemode`, `fleettools.gamemode.others` (default: operators only)

### Keep Inventory System

- **`/keepinv`** - Toggle your personal keep inventory setting (enabled by default)
- **`/keepinv status`** - Check your current keep inventory status
- **`/keepinv <player>`** - Toggle keep inventory for another player (admin only)
- Permission: `fleettools.keepinv`, `fleettools.keepinv.others` (default: all players for self, operators for others)

The keep inventory system is an opt-out feature that allows players to keep their items on death without affecting the server's gamerule. By default, all players have keep inventory enabled, but they can turn it off if they prefer the vanilla experience. Players still lose XP when they die, maintaining some consequence for death.

This system works with modded inventories, trinkets, and backpacks, ensuring comprehensive item protection regardless of which inventory expansion mods are installed. **AFK players are fully supported** - inventory data is stored persistently and will be restored even if players don't respawn for extended periods or disconnect while dead.
